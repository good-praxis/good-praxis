### Well you found me
Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ 

I'm a Software Engineer in my Twenties, passionate about **emerging web technologies**, **React** and **Godot**!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in the web development sphere, hit me up if you got something in **Berlin** or remotely that you need help with. *(Hit me up extra if you have an opportunity with Godot)*.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: They/them, He/him
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot from [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) courses. I recently completed their [Professional](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/professional/) path. I am also about to jump into [![Open Source Society University - Bioinformatics ](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-bioinformatics-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-source-society/bioinformatics), an area that always fascinated me.
